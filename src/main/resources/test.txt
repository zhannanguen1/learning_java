The exception you see - that I would strongly recommend a) to catch as a specific type, e.g.
IOException, and b) to log or show with a message or a stack trace, and c) at least to check
for in LogCat, from the DDMS perspective if you are programming with Eclipse - is probably due to
Android not finding the config.txt file you are trying to open. Usually,
for the simplest cases such as yours, files that are private to an application
 are opened using openFileInput - see the documentation for details.
